                <b>Lohri</b> is one of the most popular festivals of <b>Punjab</b>, celebrated with immense joy and enthusiasm, especially in rural areas. It marks the end of the winter season and the harvesting of the rabi crops, particularly sugarcane, wheat, and mustard. Celebrated on 13th January every year, Lohri holds great cultural significance, especially for farmers and newlyweds or families with newborns.
The main attraction of Lohri is the bonfire, around which families and communities gather in the evening. People dress in vibrant traditional attire, sing folk songs like “Sunder Mundriye”, and perform energetic Bhangra and Gidda dances. Offerings of rewri, gajak, groundnuts, and popcorn are thrown into the fire as a way of thanking the Sun God for a good harvest and praying for prosperity.

Lohri also carries spiritual importance for Sikhs and Hindus alike. It is believed to commemorate the story of Dulla Bhatti, a Punjabi folk hero who helped save girls from being sold into slavery during the Mughal era.

Overall, Lohri is not just a harvest festival but a celebration of life, warmth, and togetherness that strengthens the community spirit of Punjab.

            <div class="col-md-9 p-3"><b>Baisakhi</b>, also known as <b>Vaisakhi</b>, is one of the most important festivals in Punjab, celebrated with immense joy and devotion. It falls on 13th or 14th April every year and marks the beginning of the harvest season for rabi crops like wheat. Farmers express gratitude to God for a bountiful harvest and pray for future prosperity.

For the Sikh community, Baisakhi holds deep religious significance as it commemorates the formation of the Khalsa Panth by Guru Gobind Singh Ji in 1699. On this day, Guru Ji baptized the first five Sikhs, known as the Panj Pyare, and established the foundation of the Sikh brotherhood.

The festival is celebrated with great enthusiasm across Punjab. People visit Gurdwaras, take part in Nagar Kirtans (religious processions), and attend kirtans (devotional singing). Langars (community kitchens) are organized to feed the devotees. In villages, people perform traditional dances like Bhangra and Gidda, showcasing Punjab's vibrant spirit.

Baisakhi is not only a religious event but also a symbol of unity, courage, and cultural pride for Punjabis all over the world.

<b>Teej</b> is a traditional Punjabi festival celebrated mainly by <b>women</b> during the monsoon season, usually in the months of July or August. It is a festival that symbolizes <b>love, beauty, and devotion</b>, especially among married women, who pray for the well-being and long life of their husbands.

On Teej, women dress up in green attire, wear bangles, apply mehndi (henna) on their hands, and sing folk songs. They gather in groups to enjoy swings hung from trees, which is a highlight of the celebration. The festival also represents feminine grace and joy, providing women an opportunity to celebrate their traditions freely.

In some parts of Punjab, traditional dances like Gidda are performed, and delicious food is prepared. The festive spirit is enhanced by songs of love and longing, often associated with the tale of Goddess Parvati and Lord Shiva, whose union is celebrated on this day.

Teej is not only a cultural celebration but also a time for social bonding, fun, and honoring the strength and beauty of womanhood.

<div class="col-md-9 p-3">
Gurpurab refers to the birth anniversaries or martyrdom days of the Sikh Gurus, and they are among the most important religious festivals in Punjab. The most widely celebrated Gurpurab is Guru Nanak Dev Ji’s birthday, which usually falls in November, followed by the birthdays of Guru Gobind Singh Ji and other revered Gurus.

These sacred days are marked by prayers, recitation of Gurbani (holy hymns), and processions called Nagar Kirtans, led by the Panj Pyare (Five Beloved Ones). The processions feature singing, martial arts displays (Gatka), and religious floats.

People visit Gurdwaras, where Akhand Path (continuous reading of the Guru Granth Sahib) is held, and Langars (free community meals) are organized, promoting equality and selfless service.

Gurpurabs are not just days of celebration but of reflection, devotion, and community unity, reminding Sikhs of the teachings and sacrifices of their Gurus. They inspire people to live a life of truth, humility, and service to humanity.

Maghi is an important Sikh festival observed on 13th January, the day following Lohri. It holds deep historical and religious significance, especially for the Sikh community, as it commemorates the martyrdom of the Forty Liberated Ones (Chali Mukte) who sacrificed their lives in the battle of Muktsar Sahib while fighting for Guru Gobind Singh Ji.

On this day, Sikhs visit Gurdwaras, particularly Gurdwara Sri Muktsar Sahib in Punjab, where a large annual religious fair (Mela Maghi) is organized. Devotees take a holy dip in the sacred Sarovar (pond) and participate in Kirtan, Katha (spiritual discourse), and Akhand Path.

The festival is not just a tribute to the brave souls but also a reminder of devotion, sacrifice, and loyalty in Sikhism. It inspires followers to uphold truth and righteousness even in the face of adversity.

Maghi is a solemn yet spiritually uplifting occasion that strengthens the faith and unity of the Sikh community.

Hola Mohalla is a unique and vibrant Sikh festival celebrated a day after Holi, usually in March. Unlike Holi, which is known for colors, Hola Mohalla focuses on martial spirit, courage, and Sikh valor. It was started by Guru Gobind Singh Ji in 1701 as a day to demonstrate the martial skills of the Sikh warriors.

The main celebrations take place at Anandpur Sahib, where thousands of Sikhs gather to witness grand processions, mock battles, Gatka (Sikh martial arts) displays, and other physical feats such as sword fighting, horse riding, and tent pegging. The atmosphere is filled with patriotic chants, spiritual songs, and kirtans.

Nagar Kirtans (religious processions) led by the Panj Pyare and decorated floats move through the streets, while langars (free community kitchens) serve food to all.

Hola Mohalla is more than a festival—it is a spiritual and physical expression of Sikh values, blending devotion, discipline, courage, and community service, and serves as a powerful reminder of the Sikh warrior tradition.

    <img src="basant-panchami.jpg" class="Rounded " align="left" width="300" height="250"> 
</div><div class="col-md-9 p-3">Basant Panchami is a joyful festival celebrated in Punjab to mark the arrival of spring and is usually observed in late January or early February. It is dedicated to Goddess Saraswati, the goddess of wisdom, knowledge, and learning. In Punjab, however, the festival also has a strong cultural and seasonal significance.

The most iconic part of Basant Panchami in Punjab is kite flying. The skies are filled with colorful kites, and friendly kite battles take place on rooftops, especially in cities like Ludhiana, Amritsar, and Hoshiarpur. People wear yellow clothes, as yellow is associated with energy, prosperity, and the mustard fields that bloom during this season.

Delicious traditional foods are prepared, and children often participate in school celebrations where they worship books and instruments of learning. Though it has religious roots in Hindu tradition, in Punjab, Basant Panchami is more of a vibrant cultural event that brings people together to enjoy the beauty of spring and celebrate joy, renewal, and knowledge.
